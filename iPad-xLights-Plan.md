# xLights iPad — Implementation Plan

This file tracks overall status. Details for each phase live under
[`plans/`](plans/README.md) — one focused sub-plan per phase, listing
only the work still to do. Completed phases have no sub-plan.

## Current state

### Goal of the work so far

The work so far has been scoped to the **core rendering path**: load a
sequence, render it through the same C++ effect pipeline as desktop
xLights, and display the house preview during playback. That is done
and verified on a physical iPad. Shaders, video effects, and most
effects render correctly.

Everything above the core baseline — effects grid, inspector, output,
preview chrome — has been rebuilt for touch. The effects grid is now
Metal-backed, the inspector is metadata-driven with a four-tab shell,
and both previews are interactive on device. A 2026-04-20 parity
audit caught ~100 missing authoring behaviours vs desktop; across the
2026-04-20 and 2026-04-21 sessions the full P0 bundle and 20+ P1s
landed (multi-select + marquee, every align variant, timing-mark
editing + loop region + tags-less-tags, phrase and word breakdown,
lyric sub-layer rendering, follow-playhead, trackpad scroll, drag-to-
scrub, waveform filters, pointer hover, `.xtiming` I/O, import lyrics,
auto-label, cut/copy row + model, multi-effect clipboard with relative
timing, and column-resize). Open work is **6 P1s** (tags B34/B35,
randomize/reset B15, presets-menu stub B19, export-model B49, visible
scrollbars B94) plus ~40 P2 polish items — see
[`plans/phase-b-grid-parity.md`](plans/phase-b-grid-parity.md).

### Code layout

iPad code lives at `src-iPad/` at the repo root (peer to `src-ui-wx/`).
It is not under `macOS/`: code in `macOS/` cannot depend on anything
outside `macOS/`, so the iPad UI sits alongside the other UI layer
instead.

```
src-iPad/
  App/            SwiftUI views + view model
  Bridge/         ObjC++ bridges (XLSequenceDocument, iPadRenderContext,
                  XLiPadInit, CoreGraphicsTextDrawingContext,
                  XLValueCurve)
  Metal/          xlStandaloneMetalCanvas, iPadModelPreview,
                  XLMetalBridge, iPadGridPreview, XLGridMetalBridge
  Metadata/       EffectMetadata.swift (JSON model for effectmetadata/*.json)
```

Shared core that iPad consumes:

- `src-core/` — wx-free C++ core (renderers, models, outputs, render
  engine, effect manager, sequence file/elements, audio manager).
- `macOS/src-apple-core/` — Apple shared code (Metal device manager,
  external hooks, Apple utilities in Swift and ObjC++).

### Xcode targets

| Target | Purpose | Multi-platform |
|---|---|---|
| `xLights-core` | wx-free core (`src-core/`) | macOS + iOS |
| `xLights-Apple-core` | Apple shared code (`macOS/src-apple-core/`) | macOS + iOS |
| `xLights-macOSLib-UI` | macOS-only UI (`macOS/src-mac-ui/`) | macOS only |
| `xLights` | Desktop app | macOS only |
| `EffectComputeFunctions` | Metal shaders | macOS + iOS |
| `UIMetalShaders` | UI Metal shaders | macOS only |
| `ISPCEffectComputeFunctions` | SIMD kernels | macOS + iOS |
| `xLights-iPadLib` | iPad bridge code (`src-iPad/`) | iOS |
| `xLights-iPad` | SwiftUI iPad app | iOS 26+ |

iOS dependencies live at `/opt/xLights-macOS-dependencies/lib-ios/`:
`libcurl.a`, `libEGL.xcframework`, `libGLESv2.xcframework` (ANGLE),
`libliquidfun.a`, `liblua.a`, `libxlsxwriter.a`, `libzstd.a`. Debug
variants in `libdbg-ios/`.

## Phase status

| Phase | Title | Status | Sub-plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Core-path hardening | ✓ complete | — (one small follow-up in [`plans/followups.md`](plans/followups.md)) |
| B | Effects grid parity with desktop | In progress — all original P0s closed + 20+ P1s landed across 2026-04-20/21 (loop region, waveform filters, word breakdown, `.xtiming` I/O, import lyrics, auto-label, cut/copy row+model, multi-effect clipboard, pointer hover, column resize, etc.). **6 P1s open** (tags B34/B35, randomize B15, presets stub B19, export model B49, scrollbars B94) + ~40 P2 polish. | [`plans/phase-b-grid-parity.md`](plans/phase-b-grid-parity.md) |
| B-Metal | Grid render pipeline migration (CG → Metal) | ✓ complete | — |
| C | Effect settings inspector | ✓ complete — two polish follow-ups (MH colour/path authoring, DMX state persistence) tracked in [`plans/followups.md`](plans/followups.md) | — |
| D | Model Preview + preview polish | ✓ complete — layout-editor overlays parked in [`plans/future-layout-editing.md`](plans/future-layout-editing.md) | [`plans/phase-d-preview.md`](plans/phase-d-preview.md) |
| E | Sequence management (open / save / new / settings) | ✓ complete — E-1 through E-6 shipped 2026-04-21. Deferred tabs (Timings import/export, Audio Tracks, Data Layers) + `.fseq` emission tracked in [`plans/followups.md`](plans/followups.md) | — |
| F | Window system + Display Elements | ✓ complete 2026-04-21 — F-1 scene-level split, F-2/F-3 responsive+docked layout, F-4 menu bar / `.commands`, F-5 persistence (session destruction + main-window minimum-size floor + detach-state AppStorage), and F-6 Display Elements editor all landed. Known iPadOS limitation: Stage Manager caches window position outside SwiftUI's reach, so main can relaunch in the last-active scene's corner — self-corrects after one drag-reposition. Detached scene-owned preview state (is3D, camera, layoutGroup) deferred — not worth the refactor given session-destruction policy. | [`plans/phase-f-window-system.md`](plans/phase-f-window-system.md) |
| G | Document / iCloud polish | ✓ complete 2026-04-21 — `.xsq` registered as a document type (G-3) with `.onOpenURL` handling for Files/AirDrop integration; `NSFileCoordinator.coordinate(writingItemAt:)` on all sequence writes (G-1); iCloud ubiquity badges + on-demand download in the picker (G-2); controller output stopped cleanly on background (G-4). `.xsqz` support deferred — SequencePackage extraction not yet plumbed into the iPad bridge. | [`plans/phase-g-document.md`](plans/phase-g-document.md) |
| H | App Store readiness | Not started | [`plans/phase-h-app-store.md`](plans/phase-h-app-store.md) |

**Parallelism.** Phase B is the only remaining pre-Phase-F work;
it runs against the Metal grid + `SequencerViewModel` + row
headers. Phase F composes the finished pieces (previews,
inspector, grid) plus the File-menu commands (E) into the final
window / menu-bar layout. G and H are sequential at the end.

**Preview scope.** Phase D is preview *viewing and appearance*: camera,
overlays, background, labels, transport, export. Desktop `ModelPreview`
also hosts the layout editor (drag-to-move, resize handles, polyline
editing, align/distribute, property grid) — that behaviour stays
desktop-only and is not in Phase D or anywhere else in the iPad plan.
Per-view model visibility / layout-group management is Phase F.

### Deferred / explicitly out of MVP

- **Controller output** — infrastructure is in the tree (output
  manager, per-frame send, sACN / ArtNet / DDP / OPC) but not on the
  MVP critical path. Revisit after App Store submission.
- **JobPool requeue redesign** — desktop-scope refactor to replace
  block-on-other-model-frame with re-enqueue. Tracked separately; the
  iPad workaround is "more threads."
- **Layout editor, controller setup** — stays desktop-only.

---

## Risks

- **JobPool deadlock on complex sequences** — mitigated by raising the
  thread count; the underlying "workers block on peers" pattern is
  still there.
- **Memory on mid-tier iPads** — Phase A memory-pressure handling is
  in place but under-tested.
- **AVFoundation codec coverage** — video effects with unusual codecs
  fail; no FFmpeg fallback on iPad.

## Open questions

1. For Phase H (App Store), existing Apple Developer team? And is the
   iPad app a separate App Store record or shipped as a universal app
   alongside macOS? (Impacts bundle id and entitlements.)
